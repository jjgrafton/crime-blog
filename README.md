Created a full-stack web app for a true-crime blog, using HTML, CSS, Sinatra and ActiveRecord. Users can sign up, submit posts, edit their profile, and view all other posts, while also clicking on the name of another user will display just that user's posts. As of 30 April 2018 there are some functionality issues to be smoothed over, and there are CSS changes to be made. Future versions will allow comments and tags.
